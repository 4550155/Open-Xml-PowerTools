The Open XML PowerTools provides guidance and example code for programming with Open XML
Documents (DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX).  It is based on, and extends the functionality
in the Open XML SDK (https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK).

It supports scenarios such as:
- Splitting DOCX/PPTX files into multiple files.
- Combining multiple DOCX/PPTX files into a single file.
- Populating content in template DOCX files with data from XML.
- High-fidelity conversion of DOCX to HTML.
- Managing tracked-revisions, including detecting tracked revisions, and accepting tracked revisions.
- Updating Charts in DOCX/PPTX files, including updating cached data, as well as the embedded XLSX.
- Retrieving metrics from DOCX files, including the hierarchy of styles used, the languages used, and the fonts used.
- Searching and replacing content in DOCX/PPTX using regular expressions.
- Writing XLSX files using far simpler code than directly writing the markup, including a streaming approach that
  enables writing XLSX files with millions of rows.

News
====
We are happy to announce the release of the Open XML PowerTools Version 4.0.  There are lots of new features in 4.0, including:
- Renaming the project and the PowerShell module to Open-Xml-PowerTools, to be consistent with the Open-Xml-Sdk.
- DocumentAssembler module, which enables populating a template DOCX with data from an XML file.
- SpreadsheetWriter module, which enables writing far simpler code to generate an XLSX file, and enables a streaming approach.
- Many xUnit tests!!!, which will enable a far nimbler process for accepting contributes to PowerTools via Git pull requests.

Build Instructions
==================

To use the PowerShell Cmdlets, you need not install Visual Studio.  The following video shows how to install and use PowerTools
so that you can use the Cmdlets:

<insert video here>

The short form of the installation instructions are:
1)  Make sure you are running PowerShell 3.0 or later
2)  If necessary, run PowerShell as administrator, Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted (or RemoteSigned)
3)  Clone Open-Xml-PowerTools to %HOMEDRIVE%/%HOMEUSER%/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Modules/Open-Xml-PowerTools
4)  Import the module in PowerShell:  Import-Module Open-Xml-PowerTools

To build the library, you must have some version of Visual Studio
installed.  Visual Studio Community Edition will work just fine:
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx

To build the Open XML SDK:
- clone the repo at https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK
- Start a Visual Studio command prompt, and check into the directory that contains the repo
- Use MSBUILD to build the SDK  (C:> MSBUILD Open-Xml-Sdk.sln)
- In your program that uses the Open XML SDK, add references to the newly built libraries in bin/Debug

Instead of using MSBUILD, you can also open the solution using Visual Studio and build it.
